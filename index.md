[Analysis and Prediction of Voter Turnout Percentage in USA](https://github.com/rakesh-emuru/Data-Science/tree/main/Projects/Analysis%20and%20Prediction%20of%20Voter%20Turnout%20Percentage%20in%20USA)
<br/>

The purpose of this study is to provide evidence on the behaviour and some characteristics of voter turnout in the United States. To this end, the research team will examine voter turnout in the 2020 presidential election, for every county in the USA. The study will inquire on the effect of sociodemographic variables on the voter turnout. The aim is to provide a voter turnout model able to predict the optimal conditions to achieve the highest electoral turnout rates. This project will yield evidence that can be used by policymakers to inform electoral policy design and implementation.It will assist policymakers to follow evidence informed policy choices and making more Americans take part in the elections.

### Research Assistantship
[Data Science Research Assistant to Benjamin E. Bagozzi (Asst. Director of Data Science -Univ. of Delaware) 
Sep 2023 - Dec 2024](https://www.benjaminbagozzi.com/sadl.html)
<br/>
• Developed an automated process using the Python packages pdfplumber and PyTesseract, to extract and organize data from 162 inconsistent UNFCCC PDFs (including text and scanned images), addressing variable column layouts, missing values, and texts abruptly split into multiple lines, efficiently converting them into a well-structured CSV.
<br/>
• Engineered an advanced text classification solution in Python using Spacy and Flair NER models, enhanced by custom rules and data dictionaries, to accurately categorize and reconstruct attendee information from diverse, unstructured documents, achieving a 92% accuracy rate.
<br/>
• Contributed to a research paper based on these methodologies, currently under review for publication.
